# simplifying protests :fist: - a simple method of classifying protest demands using machine learning 


*Detailed description of the idea and project. 

In light of recent civil unrest, including #blacklivesmatter and #metoo movements,it has never been more important for people in positions of power to listen citizen voices.

<p> For my microsoft student accelerator project, I will be trying to develop machine learning model which can read descriptions about government protests, and construct a suitable label for the event.

<p> Along with certain RSS scraping methods, I would like to extend this project to automatically label incoming news articles in accordance to protest demands. I would also love to have more comprehesive labels to describe each event, to provide insightful analysis of what specifically demands are around the world, to see if there are any similarities and differences.
    
*Environment set up and dependencies 
    
 The following packages will be required for performing my analysis. Most of which would already be available if anaconda is installed on the local machine. 
    
    *pandas
    *numpy 
    *tensorflow
    *sklearn 
    *keras 
    *matplotlib
   
 *Instructions on how I trained and tested my training model
